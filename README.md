#Buiding A Machine Learning Model For Lead Score Case Study
# Business Problem :
    X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, attracts numerous visitors to its website daily through marketing efforts on various platforms, including search engines like Google. These visitors may browse courses, fill out inquiry forms, or watch informational videos. When visitors provide their email addresses or phone numbers via these forms, they are classified as leads. Additionally, the company receives leads through past referral. Once leads are acquired, the sales team engages with them through calls and emails. However, despite acquiring a significant number of leads, X Education's lead conversion rate is relatively low, averaging around 30%. For instance, out of 100 leads acquired in a day, only about 30 are converted into customers. To improve efficiency, X Education aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads.' By focusing on these high-potential leads, the company hopes to increase its lead conversion rate, allowing the sales team to prioritize their efforts on the most likely prospects instead of reaching out to all leads indiscriminately.​
#CONCLUSION:
We evaluated the model using both Sensitivity-Specificity and Precision-Recall metrics, selecting the optimal cutoff based on Sensitivity and Specificity for final predictions. The test set shows Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity values of approximately 81.5%, 80.5%, and 82%, Precision of 74%, and Recall of 80.54%, which are close to those from the training set. The lead scoring on the training data indicates a conversion rate of around 80.57% for the final model. Overall, this model performs well and meets the expected criteria.​
